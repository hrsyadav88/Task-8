## ✅ Summary of Steps Taken

1. Downloaded and installed NordVPN.
2. Logged in and connected to a U.S. server (Miami).
3. Visited [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) to confirm:
   - IP changed
   - Location spoofed
   - VPN successfully detected
4. Verified traffic encryption by browsing HTTPS websites.
5. Compared results with and without VPN.

## 🔍 Key Observations

### ✔️ Benefits
- IP masking and location spoofing worked as expected
- Data routed through encrypted VPN tunnel
- New ISP and virtual location confirmed via external tools

### ⚠️ Limitations
- IPv6 was disabled during VPN session (common behavior)
- Some websites may still detect VPN usage
- Speeds may slightly reduce depending on the server load

---

## 🎯 Conclusions

Using NordVPN provided:
- **Enhanced online privacy**
- **Protection from ISP tracking**
- **Secure connection over public networks**
- **Ability to bypass geo-restrictions**

Overall, VPNs are a valuable tool in a cybersecurity toolkit but require careful selection of providers and server locations.
